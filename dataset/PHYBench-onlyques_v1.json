    "content": "This problem discusses the motion and forces on a particle in a rapidly oscillating field.  First, we discuss the one-dimensional theory in a rapidly oscillating field. Let $q$ denote the coordinate of the particle. For a particle in a potential field $V_{0}(q)$ with mass $m$, if there is a rapidly oscillating force $f( \\boldsymbol{q},t)$ acting on it (the angular frequency $ \\omega$ of $f$ is very high), its equation of motion is:  $$ m{ \\ddot{q}}=F_{0}=-{ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}V_{0}}{ \\mathrm{d}q}}(q)+f(q,t) $$    The core of the theory is to divide the actual motion into fast motion (high-frequency oscillation) and slow motion (average motion): fast motion is denoted as $x(t)$, and slow motion is denoted as $X$. Due to the high frequency, the response of $x$ is very small, that is $x \\ll X$. Expanding the above equation:  $$ m \\ddot{X}+m \\ddot{x}=- \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}V_{0}}{ \\mathrm{d}q} \\Big \\vert_{X}- \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \\mathrm{d}q^{2}} \\Big \\vert_{X} \\cdot x+f(X,t)+ \\frac{ \\partial f}{ \\partial x} \\Big \\vert_{X,t} \\cdot x $$    First, solve for fast motion: $ \\begin{array}{r}{m \\ddot{x}=- \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \\mathrm{d}q^{2}} \\Big \\vert_{X} \\cdot x+f(X,t)} \\end{array}$, which is evidently a forced oscillation. Considering the high-frequency approximation, that is $ \\begin{array}{r} { m \\omega^{2} \\gg \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^{2}V_{0}}{ \\mathrm{d}q^{2}} \\bigg|_{X}} \\end{array}$, we obtain  $$ x=-{ \\frac{1}{m \\omega^{2}}}f(X,t) $$    Thus, in fact, when studying rapidly oscillating forces, the second term on the right side of the equation does not have any practical effect.   Next, solve for the slow motion. Substitute the result of the fast motion into the actual dynamical equation to obtain the slow motion. Extending this situation to three dimensions, if $  abla \\times f=0$, the effective potential $F_{ \\mathrm{eff}}=-  abla V_{ \\mathrm{eff}}$ can be written down.

Moreover, for this chaotic problem, as long as basic physical laws (such as energy conservation and rigidity assumptions) are satisfied, all states can occur—it is merely a matter of how much time it takes.

To account for this effect, an exponential term is introduced to truncate the high-energy modes. The truncation position is arbitrary, so we expect it will not affect any measurable quantities. Assume that when summing over different electromagnetic wave modes to obtain the total energy, a Boltzmann factor is introduced, i.e.,\n$$\nE=\\sum_{j}e_{j}^{-\\frac{E_{j}}{\\Lambda}}E_{j}\n$$\nwhere $E_{j}$ is the zero-point energy for each mode, and $\\Lambda$ is a constant.\n\nFind the Casimir force $F_{(x)}$ in the lowest-order approximation, assuming $L \\gg x$ and $h c \\ll x\\Lambda$.",

It explained the challenges of classical electrodynamics regarding electron radiation and atomic stable states, as well as the results of spectroscopic observations at the time. Due to the limitations of quantum theory during its early development, it underwent modifications by Sommerfeld and others, eventually leading directly to the establishment of the Schrödinger equation by Schrödinger and others, which serves as the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the Bohr model, the principal quantum number $n$ simultaneously determines the energy and angular momentum of the electron state, which is actually incorrect. Through observation of hydrogen atoms in electric fields and magnetic fields, we point out that degenerate states under the same principal quantum number $n$ with different angular quantum numbers $l$, magnetic quantum numbers $m$, and even spin quantum numbers $s$ will experience energy level splitting. Specifically, some states' energy levels increase, while others decrease, and spectroscopic observations can reveal distinct spectral lines resulting from electronic level transitions between different states. The Stark effect is a typical effect when the hydrogen atom couples with an electric field. This problem attempts to estimate of the magnitude of energy level splitting due to the Stark effect using a semi-classical approach.\n\nConsider the slow evolution of the electron's orbital in space under the influence of a weak uniform electric field $\\vec{E}$. First, consider a simpler situation where at time $t=0$, the normal vector $\\vec{n}$ of the plane of the electron's orbit and the electric field strength $\\vec{E}$, along with the axis pointing from the nucleus to the pericenter of the orbit (the $x$-axis), are all situated in the $xOz$ plane, with an angle $\\theta$ between the latter two. Use the perturbation method to prove that the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron's orbit does not change over time, and the orbit merely precesses around the direction of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ (that is, rotates around the axis). Determine this angular velocity $\\Omega$. Given the orbital energy $-U$, eccentricity $e$, electron mass $m$, and the magnitude of charge for both the atomic nucleus and electron as $q$.\n\nHint: The so-called perturbation method refers to calculating the instantaneous derivative of the dynamical conserved quantity of the original system under the action of the newly added perturbing force at each moment. Substitute the position and velocity of the periodic motion of the original system into this derivative and calculate the periodic average.

Even today, with transportation methods and technology rapidly changing, bicycles are still considered the most labor-saving and superior non-motorized means of transportation and are highly regarded for their outstanding environmental protection benefits. Early research on bicycles focused on gear coupling, pedal acceleration, and similar processes, but the study of bicycle control stability has been challenging. Why does a bicycle with two wheels remain stable while moving and not topple over? For over a hundred years, this question has intrigued many famous mechanicians, physicists, and mathematicians, resulting in more than a hundred renowned papers published in various languages such as English, German, French, Russian, and Italian. In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences even offered a reward for this research. Today, the study of the control and riding stability of bicycles with different structures and parameters continues to be a hot topic in the engineering field.\n(In this problem, the rider does not hold the handlebar and imparts no force on it)\nA ridden bicycle can ensure its own stability and not fall over. Based on our own experience, the faster the speed, the better the stability. However, is it possible to attach some devices to the bicycle to make it stable and upright even when stationary? Below, we provide a schematic of a bicycle structure with an attached momentum wheel, where a brushless motor is fixed to the bicycle body, connected to a momentum wheel, and can be driven by the motor to achieve any desired angular velocity.\n\nNext, we simplify this system. Since we are now studying the upright stability of the bicycle in a non-moving state, we can consider the front and rear wheels, body, and motor as a rigid body, abstracted as a homogeneous rigid rod that can only rotate in the plane around the contact point with the ground. The rod has a length $L$, mass $M$, and the momentum wheel connected to the rod's end can be driven by the motor to achieve any angular velocity. The momentum wheel is viewed as a disk with mass $m$ and radius $r$. (Ignore lateral slip at point $O$)\n\nIf the bicycle body obtains a clockwise rotation angle $\\theta$ , the angular velocity that the previously stationary momentum wheel subsequently needs to acquire is \n\nIn fact, when the bicycle tilt angle changes, the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the momentum wheel should also change correspondingly. We assume that sensors installed on the bicycle body can record the tilt angle $\\theta$ and feedback to the motor, allowing the momentum wheel to acquire an angular acceleration of size $\\dot{\\omega}=K\\theta$. To bring the bicycle back to a balanced position, solve for the dependency of $\\omega$ on time $t$. ( $\\theta<<1$, ignore any resistance, at $t=0$, $\\theta=\\theta_{0},\\dot{\\theta}=0$, and the angular velocity of the momentum wheel is 0)",

In this convention, the most general form of a traveling wave is expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\psi(x,t)=A e^{i(\\pm k x-\\omega t)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the magnitude of the wave vector, the $\"+\"$ sign represents a wave traveling to the right, and the $\"-\"$ sign represents a wave traveling to the left. $A$ is the complex amplitude (its magnitude corresponds to the amplitude, while its phase angle contains the information about the phase). Next, we will consider transverse waves on a string, whose wave equation is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial x^{2}}-\\frac{1}{u^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial t^{2}}=0\n$$  \n\nwhere $u$ is the wave velocity. When $k$ and $\\omega$ in the traveling wave expression satisfy $\\omega/k=u$, it is a solution to the wave equation above. Due to the linearity of the wave equation, the superposition of solutions to the traveling wave is also a solution to this equation.  \n\nBoth ends A and B of a string are fixed to supports. We establish a coordinate axis with the midpoint (point O) as the origin and the positive direction of the $x$-axis pointing to the right. Thus, the coordinates of endpoints A and B are $±l/2$, where $l$ is the length of the string. At a point with a coordinate of $a$ on the string, a driver C with an angular frequency of $\\omega$ is installed, causing all mass elements on the string to oscillate with an angular frequency of $\\omega$.  \n\nLet the amplitude reflection coefficient at the string's connection point with the supports be $\\boldsymbol{r}$, which is defined as the ratio of the complex amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave at the reflection point.

Using this property, we can write the relationship satisfied by the wave functions $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$ to the left and right of C.

    "content": "The Blue Star people have always fantasized about one day being able to abandon the inefficient transportation method of rockets and directly establish a \"sky ladder\" from the ground to the heavens. Some call it a \"space elevator,\" while others refer to it as an \"orbital lift.\" However, they do not realize that due to the limitations imposed by physical laws, building a space elevator on the Blue Star is unrealistic. In contrast, several years later, on Mars, which is farther from the sun, space elevators can \"stand tall.\"\n\nAs early as the Book of Genesis in the Bible, humans hoped to jointly construct a towering tower that reaches from the ground to the sky—the Tower of Babel—to spread their fame. The person who first proposed the concept of a space elevator should be Russia's \"father of rockets\"—Tsiolkovsky. His envisioned space elevator extends from the ground to the geostationary orbit, tens of thousands of kilometers high. As the elevator rises, the gravity inside gradually decreases. When cargo reaches the endpoint with the elevator, its speed is enough to maintain synchronous orbital movement around the Earth. Therefore, the station at the geostationary orbit is in a completely weightless state.\n\nIn 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel, \"The Fountains of Paradise,\" first brought this advanced concept of the space elevator into the public's view. Since then, space elevators have widely existed in various science fiction works. Whether it's the space elevator made with advanced nanomaterials in \"The Three-Body Problem\" or the three orbital lifts during the three-way division among Union, AEU, and Human Reform League in \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00,\" their basic concepts and principles are the same.\n\nNowadays, we can occasionally hear some related news reports, whether it's the Japanese company \"Obayashi Corporation\" planning to complete the first space elevator by 2050, or a Canadian company proposing a new space elevator plan. Regardless of whether these are just commercial companies engaging in hype, such news does indeed cause more people to wonder—are we really close to the era of abandoning rockets and embracing space elevators?\n\nIs this really the case? How far away are we from the technology required to build space elevators? We will conduct a detailed analysis in this question (the space elevators mentioned below are all built at the equator, and any bending is not considered).\n\nIn fact, whether a material is destroyed or not depends not only on the magnitude of the force but also on the area over which the force acts. This is easy to understand; under the same amount of tension, thinner pipes are more easily pulled apart. Therefore, we need to use \"stress (force divided by the area of action)\" to measure whether a space elevator will be damaged. If the cross-sectional area of the space elevator is uniform, then obviously the place where the force is greatest, in other words, the geostationary orbit area, is the most prone to breaking.\n\nDo we have any way to make the stress inside the entire space elevator equal? Of course we do! We know that the tension increases with height, so the cross-sectional area of an equal strength (internally equal tensile stress) space elevator should also increase with height. Therefore, the optimized space elevator design changes from a uniformly thick \"catenary\" to a funnel-shaped \"catenary\" with a thick top and thin bottom.\n\nIn this question, we use the following model: A mass at the end of the space elevator is considered infinitely large to ensure that only tensile forces act inside the elevator, so there is no force acting at the contact point with the ground. The elevator is thick at the top and thin at the bottom, with each cross-section having an equal tensile stress of σ. The material density is ρ, and the material elongation is not considered. The cross-sectional area at the ground level is \\(A_{0}\\). Solve the following problem:\n\nFind the expression for the cross-sectional area \\(A_{x}\\) at a distance \\(X\\) from the center of the Earth, expressed in terms of \\(g\\), \\(R\\), \\(\\omega_{0}\\) (Earth's rotational angular velocity), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(A_{0}\\).",

The origin is set at the middle point of the cylinder on the axis, and the axial direction is the \\( z \\)-axis (the direction of current is the +z direction), with the radial coordinate denoted as \\( r \\). At a certain moment, a relativistic particle with charge \\( +q \\) and momentum magnitude \\( p_0 \\) (the magnitude to be determined) is emitted from a particle source at \\( z=0, r=r_0 (r_0>R) \\), in the direction along the +z axis. It is assumed that the plasma is sufficiently sparse, so the particle only experiences the magnetic field generated by the plasma lens, and even if it enters within the cylindrical plasma lens, collisions between the particle and the plasma can be completely ignored. Since the plasma is considered a good conductor, the electric field within it has negligible effect on the charged particle. It is assumed that the magnetic permeability of the plasma equals the vacuum permeability \\( \\mu_0 \\).  During the focusing process, particles with smaller momentum may reverse direction within the plasma lens (i.e., have a momentum z-component opposite to the initial direction), a situation known as over-focusing of the plasma lens. To allow the charged particle to transmit in the axial direction without reversing, find the particle's minimum initial momentum \\( p_0 \\).  Note: For convenience, you may need to assume the particle's rest mass or speed, but surprisingly, the final result depends only on momentum. This actually allows us to conveniently use readily available particles to simulate less common situations—for example, using a large and stable number of high-energy protons produced by an accelerator to simulate the extremely rare muons in cosmic rays, as long as their momentum is equal.",

It is profound for its unique concepts of spacetime and matter, elegant for its geometric mathematical structure, and distinguished for its successful predictions of physical phenomena, garnering the attention of later theoretical physicists. Mr. Yang Zhenning once said that the Yang-Mills theory (the main theory governing our understanding of the other three fundamental interactions) is actually similar in mathematical structure to general relativity.\n\nAs a crucial part of verifying general relativity, in 1919, Sir Arthur Eddington embarked on an expedition to Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea, leading an experiment observing the deflection of starlight during a solar eclipse, which directly announced the validity of general relativity to the world. Let's use a non-relativistic equivalent method to derive the classical results of this experiment. It can be proven that if a light ray originating from infinity behaves like a particle in general, incident with an impact parameter $b$ and its propagation direction being deflected under the gravitational field of a centrally fixed celestial body $M$, then its trajectory will be identical to that in a refractive index field $n(r)$.

    "content": "Percolation is a geometric phase transition with profound significance in the study of localization and related topics. We use a model here to understand it. On a 2D lattice, lattice points can be occupied by black particles or be empty (white particles). The probability of placing a black particle is $p$, and the probability of being empty is $q=1-p$, where $N$ is the total number of particles.\n\nIt is clear that the probability of large clusters $\\mathrm{\\Delta}s$ appearing, where $n_{s}(p)$ at low values of $p$ is significant, decreases rapidly with $s$. However, when $p$ is large, one observes the emergence of macroscale $s$, which is the localization phenomenon. The transition occurring with $p$ is referred to as percolation. To study this problem, consider the influence between lattice points and transform it. We provide some approximate treatments: firstly, the number density of black particles is redefined as a dynamically changing $n$. We treat it as a function containing time $t$ and lattice coordinates $(x,y)$, and continuoize $(x,y)$ into a two-dimensional real number set instead of integer lattice coordinates. In our simple continuum model, the flux of number density between lattice points is exactly proportional to the gradient of the number density (consistent with the two-dimensional diffusion problem). However, in the actual discrete model, when localization occurs, a lattice point with certain probability is in a connected large cluster, with an internal number density always being 1; or the lattice point is located in an empty space or a small cluster with other probabilities, where the number density is less than 1. This links the continuous model with the discrete model: if the continuous model's $n(x,y)$ ultimately forms a stable distribution $n(r)$ rotationally symmetric around the origin and time-independent, where $r=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, in this model, take a circle of radius $r_{0}$ such that the total number of particles inside is $N$, representing the characteristic particle number of a large cluster, and the edge particle number density $n(r_{0})$ should be related to the critical probability $p_{c}$ at which localization begins. We directly assume $n(r_{0})\\cdot\\pi r_{0}^{2}=p_{c}N$. Now, let $N=1$, and use $p_{c},r_{0}$ to represent $n(r)$.",

    "content": "The Magnus effect is a common fluid dynamics phenomenon in our daily lives. In real situations, the Magnus effect is very complex. This problem uses a simplified model without viscosity derived from the Kutta–Joukowski theorem to deduce a formula for the Magnus effect. The Kutta–Joukowski theorem describes a scenario where a cylinder and air are in relative motion, and the cylinder rotates around an axis perpendicular to its base. The cylinder will experience a force perpendicular to the angular velocity vector and the direction of relative motion velocity. The magnitude of the force per unit length along the cylinder's axis is $f=\\rho V_{air} \\Gamma$ (the direction of relative motion to air must be perpendicular to the angular velocity direction), where $\\rho$ is the air density (known), $V_{air}$ is the relative motion speed of air and the cylinder as a whole, unaffected by the cylinder’s movement at infinity, and $\\Gamma$ is the circulation satisfying the loop integral $\\Gamma=|\\int \\vec{v}\\cdot d\\vec{l}|$, where the integral path is the circumference of the base of the cylinder. In this problem, you can consider $\\vec{v}$ as the speed generated at the edge points due to the rotation of the cylinder. Air resistance is not considered in this problem, and the air is considered stationary relative to the ground. Now there is a sphere rotating around a horizontal axis passing through its center at an angular velocity $\\omega$, while moving horizontally at a speed of $V$ perpendicular to the rotation axis relative to the ground. The sphere has a radius of $R$. Try to find the lift force magnitude caused by this motion of the sphere (the problem assures that the directions of angular velocity and motion velocity result in an upward lift on the sphere).",

Some call it the \"Space Elevator,\" while others refer to it as the \"Orbital Lift.\" However, they do not realize that due to the limitations imposed by physical laws, building a space elevator on Blue Planet is unrealistic. In contrast, years later, on Mars, which is further from the Sun, space elevators can \"stand tall.\"\n\nAs early as in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, humans hoped to jointly construct a giant tower reaching from the ground to the sky—the Tower of Babel—to proclaim their fame. The person who first proposed the concept of a space elevator should be the Russian \"father of rockets,\" Tsiolkovsky. The space elevator he envisioned would extend from the ground to the geosynchronous orbit tens of thousands of kilometers high. As the elevator ascends, the internal gravity gradually decreases. When cargo reaches the endpoint via the elevator, its speed already allows it to maintain synchronous orbital motion around Earth. Therefore, the synchronous orbit station is in a state of complete weightlessness.\n\nIn 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\" introduced the revolutionary concept of the space elevator to the public's attention. Since then, space elevators have been widely present in various sci-fi works. Whether it is the space elevator made of advanced nanomaterials in \"The Three-Body Problem\" or the three orbital lifts operated by Union, AEU, and Human Reform League in \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00,\" the basic concepts and principles are the same.\n\nNowadays, we occasionally hear some related news reports, either from Japan's company \"Obayashi Corporation\" planning to build the first space elevator by 2050, or from a Canadian company proposing new space elevator schemes. Regardless of whether these are commercial companies creating hype, such news indeed prompts more people to wonder—are we really close to the era of abandoning rockets and embracing space elevators?\n\nIs this really the case? How far away are we from the technology needed to build a space elevator? We will conduct a detailed analysis in this matter (the space elevators discussed here are all constructed at the equator, with no consideration for any curvature).\n\nIn Tsiolkovsky's vision, the space elevator following Earth's rotation would reach a certain height, after which a satellite released freely would automatically become a geostationary satellite. Calculate the height $l_{1}$ of the space elevator in this model. Given are: gravitational acceleration $g$, Earth's radius $R$, and Earth's rotation period $T_{day}$.",
